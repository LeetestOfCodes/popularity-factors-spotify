# popularity-factors-spotify
A two-person project that goes through the most popular songs of the past seven decades, and finds factors that can quantitatively affect a song's popularity.


# Important Note on the Project
At the end of each decade, a multi-variable graph is meant to be displayed that shows various visualizations of the models used and their determinations. This occurs thanks to the evaluate_model() function. The lack of visualization here shown in the linked Colab notebook is something we are working on fixing. It should work fairly soon.
